        "Tip2": "If the enemy starts attacking the building and you haven't received the capture yield yet (you are reinforcing for less than 1 minute), withdraw the troop to avoid the enemy attacking your troop on the building. This prevents troop losses.",
        "Tip3": "The enemy likely sent their A-team to capture the building, so they might be defenseless. Remember, if they want to attack your base with that troop, they need to send it back to their base first and then send it to your base.",

      "Title": "Attack and Defense",
      "Description1": "First, let’s discuss basic defense. You should only attempt to defend if your main troop can survive the first or second consecutive attack (i.e., the attacker is roughly at your level).",
      "Tip1": "If you can’t defend or aren’t online to make this decision, DEACTIVATE your defenses.",
      "Tip2": "To activate/deactivate defenses: Go to the wall in your base, click on the house+ icon, and deactivate the troops. Every time you unlock a new troop, make sure to deactivate it as well. Sometimes it makes sense to have no defense at all, and sometimes it makes sense to use the main troop as defense, but the biggest mistake you can make is allowing your weaker troops to participate in defense.",
      "Tip3": "Why this works: Suppose a much stronger player attacks you 5 times (let’s assume you’re level 20 with 3 troops). You would lose around 10k to 12k troops in those 5 attacks if you had 3 defense teams. If you had only a single defense (the strongest troop), you would lose about 4k to 5k troops. If you had no defense at all, you would lose about 1k troops (due to the breakthrough attack, which doesn’t count as kills for the attacker). That’s a huge difference.",
      "Tip4": "Attacking bases serves two purposes in this game: (1) to plunder resources and (2) to earn points during kill events, like the Enemy Destroyer (Day 6 of the Duel).",
      "Tip5": "Plundering offers the best resource-stamina ratio in the game, but be aware of defenses/counterattacks, your current plunder limits, etc.",
      "Tip6": "When attacking other bases for kill events, note that only fights count as kills for points. So someone without defense or without troops won’t give you event points or increase your individual kill count. That’s another reason why you should deactivate your own defenses, to prevent your opponents from earning points by attacking you.",

    "Troops": {
      "Title": "Troop/Unit Training",

      "Tip1": "Assume TX = max level of troops you can train, TY = one level below the maximum, and TZ = two levels below the maximum. The strategy is to train TZ all week long (assuming you already have enough TX for all your units). During unit training in the Arms Race, promote TZ -> TY and/or TY -> TX (you might do two rounds in each barrack without accelerators during this phase). On Day 5 of the Duel, you would promote almost all TY/TZ to TX before entering the Desert Storm battlefield or Day 6 of the Duel. Once you’ve completed the kill events, continue filling TZ.",
      "Tip2": "For example, if you’re HQ 25, then TX would be level 8 units (requires Lv24 Barrack), TY would be level 7 units (requires Lv20 Barrack), and TZ would be level 6 units (requires Lv17 Barrack). To apply this strategy, you need to keep some barracks at a level lower than the maximum possible. Of 4 barracks, I recommend having 2 that can train up to TX and 2 that can only train up to TY. This is because troop promotion automatically goes to the maximum level for that barrack.",
